# AI Fundamentals

- **Definition;** “the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men.” Marvin Minsky

- **Operational Definition;** “AI is the field of computer science that studies how to make computers do tasks for which humans are still the best today.” E.Rich

## Logial Representation
It is a language with some concrete rules that deals with propositions and havs no ambiguity in representation.

Consist of: 
- **Semantic:** well formed sentence
- **Syntaxe:** truth of the meaning to a sentence



# Logical Representation is

## 1- Proposional Logic
- PL is the simplest logic
- a proposition is a declarative statment that's either true or false. 

Propositinal logic cannot predicate or assmue, it can say either true or false.

### Truth Table

<br>

## Examples

A- It is HOT<br>
B- It is humid<br>
C- It is rainning

**Conditions:** <br>
1- If it is humid, then it is hot <br>
2- if it is hot and humid then it is not raining

|   Conditions |  Proposition Logic |
|---|---|
| Condition 1  |  B=>A | 
| Condition 2  |  A+B => C | 


### Limitation Of PL
- We cannot represent relations like **All**, **some**, or **none**.
  - **All** the girls are intelligent
  - **Some** apples are sweet.
- PL has limited expressive power.
- In PL, we cannot describe the statements in terms of their properties or logical relationships

## 2- First Order predicat logic
